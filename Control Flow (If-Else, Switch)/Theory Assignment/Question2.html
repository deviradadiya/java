       <b> Switch Statements in JavaScript</b>
        A switch statement evaluates an expression and executes code blocks based on matching cases. It is useful for handling multiple discrete values of a variable.

        When to Use Switch:
        When dealing with many conditions based on a single variable.
        When the comparison values are constants (e.g., integers, strings).
        For improved readability compared to numerous if-else statements.
