    <h3>What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?</h3>
    <pre>== (Equality Operator): Compares values for equality, performing type coercion if types differ.
        console.log(5 == '5'); // true (type coercion)

        === (Strict Equality Operator): Compares both value and type, returning true only if they are the same without type conversion.
        console.log(5 === '5'); // false (no type coercion)</pre>
